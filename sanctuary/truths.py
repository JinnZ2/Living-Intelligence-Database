# truths.py  (place this next to coherence_playground.py)
# ========================================================
# YOUR SANCTUARY SHELF -- add your own truths here.
#
# This file is imported by the coherence playground.
# You can add new domains (functions that return something observable)
# and new assertions (sentences that must always hold).
#
# Rules:
#   1. Use only standard-library Python (no extra packages).
#   2. Functions should return simple, true relationships.
#   3. Assertions should be things you have verified and will not change.
#      (If they ever break, the playground will tell you gently.)
#   4. If you add a domain function, put its name in the EXTRA_DOMAINS list
#      so the wandering can find it.
#   5. You can edit this file whenever you discover a new truth.
#      The core playground never needs to change.
